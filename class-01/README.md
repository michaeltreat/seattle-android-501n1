# Class 1 - Intro To Java  

## Learning Objectives  
* Students should have a fundamental understanding of the basics of JAVA including:  
  * Variables & Constants  
  * Numeric Types & Operations  
  * Strings  
  * Decisions  
  * Repeating Steps  
  * Methods  

## Lab Assignment  
* Get system configured to support writing command-line Java.  
* Create a new Java file called `HelloWorld.java`.  
* Define your `HelloWorld` class as public.  
* Implement the required `main(String[] args)` method as a `public` and `static` method.  
* Write a method that takes an Int parameter uses `System.out` to print it to the console.  
* Write a method that takes in 2 `String` parameters and returns them concatenated together as a String(with extra no spaces).  
* Write a method that take in a String, and returns a String in the following format:
  * return String: “String contains *n* characters”.  
* Write a method that takes in a string and reverses it.  
  * HINT: You COULD use a loop to iterate over the characters in the original String.
