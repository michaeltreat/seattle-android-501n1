# Class 6 - Twitter Client  

## User Stories (MVP)  
 - As a developer, I want to utilize the Android SDK to build an application.  
 - As a developer, I want to represent User's Tweet's in a `ListView` as a list, to fully understand how `ListView` are composed.    
- As a developer, I want to demonstrate adding local resource files to my applications.  

## Technical Requirements  
- New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine  
- Create a new Android Project named `TwitterClient-Android` in the repo directory.  
- Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history  
- Create Model objects including a class for `Tweet` and `User`.  
- Organize your files in Android Studio into proper MVC.  
- Create your `JSON` class. Use the `JSON` class to parse the `tweet.json` file into `Tweet` objects.  
	- The `tweet.json` file is included in this repository located here: [Lecture Resources](lecture/tweet.json)  
- Display tweets in a `ListView`. Do **not** use the same `Basic` cell style we used in class, instead, research another `android.R.layout` resource.  

### Stretch Goals  
- Add the functionality needed to `log` to the console, when the user selects a given tweet, the corresponding Tweet's text.  

## Submitting Your Assignment  
1. When your work is complete and ready for submission, **open a Pull Request** from `class-06` to `master`.  
2. Submit the link to the above Pull Request to Canvas  
3. Add a comment to this Canvas submission with answers to the following questions.  
  - How did this lab go, overall?  
  - What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?  
4. Once you've submitted your work, complete the merge of `class-06` to `master`
